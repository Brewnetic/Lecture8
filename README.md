# Lecture 8 In-Class Example

## Interfaces, Overriding, Overloading, and Polymorphism

### **ðŸ”¹ Ex: RPG Character System**

- **Files**: RPGExample.java
- **Topic**: Building an RPG character system using interfaces to define playable behavior, with polymorphism to handle different character classes that override attack methods and use constructor/method overloading.
- **Learning Goals**:
  - Create and implement interfaces with method signatures.
  - Understand how interfaces define contracts that classes must follow.
  - Use `@Override` annotation when implementing interface methods and overriding parent methods.
  - Implement method overloading (same method name, different parameters).
  - Implement constructor overloading (multiple constructors with different parameters).
  - Demonstrate polymorphism by storing different character types in a parent class array.
  - See how different character classes implement the same methods differently.
  - Understand dynamic method dispatch (calling overridden methods at runtime).
